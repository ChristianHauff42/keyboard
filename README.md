This is my keyboard layout for the ZSA Moonlander, written with qmk.
The layout is a modified DVORAK layout, inspired by [ThePrimeagen's layout](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/keyboards).
The primary goal with this layout is to move the fingers away from the home row as little as possibl while also being comfortable for programming.
I also added a QWERTY layer for gaming to avoid having to remap every single keybind in every game.
